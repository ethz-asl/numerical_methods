Numerical methods
=================

Simple, streamlined, templated implementations of miscellaneous numerical methods, including integration, direct minimization, and linear regression.

This package uses the [Catkin simple](https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple) build system, and so it requires a [Catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces). The [ASL's programming guidelines Wiki](https://github.com/ethz-asl/programming_guidelines/wiki) contains information on ROS/Catkin integration and some useful links.
